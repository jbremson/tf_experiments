To add a VPC endpoint in Terraform so that instances in a private subnet can use AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Connect, you will need to create two types of VPC endpoints: one for SSM and another for SSM messages. Below is an example of how to configure this in your Terraform script.

Terraform Configuration
Text Only
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"  # Change to your desired region
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-west-2a"  # Change as needed
}

resource "aws_vpc_endpoint" "ssm" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  service_name      = "com.amazonaws.us-west-2.ssm"  # Change region as needed
  route_table_ids   = [aws_subnet.private.id]
}

resource "aws_vpc_endpoint" "ssm_messages" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  service_name      = "com.amazonaws.us-west-2.ssmmessages"  # Change region as needed
  route_table_ids   = [aws_subnet.private.id]
}

resource "aws_vpc_endpoint" "ec2_messages" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  service_name      = "com.amazonaws.us-west-2.ec2messages"  # Change region as needed
  route_table_ids   = [aws_subnet.private.id]
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "ssm_role" {
  name = "SSMRole"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action    = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Principal = {
          Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        }
        Effect    = "Allow"
        Sid       = ""
      },
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ssm_policy" {
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore"
  role       = aws_iam_role.ssm_role.name
}

resource "aws_instance" "private_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Change to your desired AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.private.id

  iam_instance_profile = aws_iam_instance_profile.ssm_instance_profile.name
}

resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "ssm_instance_profile" {
  name = "SSMInstanceProfile"
  role = aws_iam_role.ssm_role.name
}
Explanation
VPC and Subnet: The script creates a VPC and a private subnet where your EC2 instances will reside.
VPC Endpoints:
SSM Endpoint: Allows communication with the SSM service.
SSM Messages Endpoint: Facilitates the messaging service for SSM.
EC2 Messages Endpoint: Required for SSM to manage EC2 instances.
IAM Role and Policy: An IAM role is created and attached to the EC2 instance, allowing it to communicate with SSM.
EC2 Instance: An EC2 instance is launched in the private subnet with the IAM role attached.
